def: "A signaling process that controls cell cycle progression by monitoring the integrity of specific cell cycle events. A cell cycle checkpoint begins with detection of deficiencies or defects and ends with signal transduction." [GOC:mtg_cell_cycle]
comment: This term should not be used in direct manual annotation as it should always be possible to minimally designate mitotic or meiotic checkpoint, and usually to additionally specify the checkpoint (i.e mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, mitotic DNA damage checkpoint etc). Note also that the effector processes are not part of the checkpoint but are positively regulated by the checkpoint signaling and should not be annotated here.

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation.

comment: Note that we deem eukaryotic cilia and microtubule-based flagella to be equivalent, while the bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella have a different structure. The former are microtubule-based structures that lash back and forth and are present only in eukaryotes, while the latter achieve motility by rotation. Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. These three structures never co-exist in the same organism. Therefore, GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term.

comment: This term should be used when the annotation refers to a process that occurs in a context of apoptotic cell death. To annotate gene products involved in activation of cysteine-type endopeptidases in other cellular process (e.g., cell cycle arrest) that do not necessarily develop into an apoptotic process, please use the more general parent term GO:0097202. Examples of 'activation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process' are cytochrome c and Apaf1. When cytochrome c is released from mitochondria and forms a complex with Apaf1, they form a scaffolding platform in which the pro-caspase 9 is bound (the 'apoptosome'). The caspase is then cleaved and activated. Cytochrome c and Apaf1 are therefore involved in the conversion of the zymogen procaspase 9 to the active form of the caspase.

name: cell death
namespace: biological_process
def: "Any biological process that results in permanent cessation of all vital functions of a cell. A cell should be considered dead when any one of the following molecular or morphological criteria is met: (1) the cell has lost the integrity of its plasma membrane; (2) the cell, including its nucleus, has undergone complete fragmentation into discrete bodies (frequently referred to as apoptotic bodies). The cell corpse (or its fragments) may be engulfed by an adjacent cell in vivo, but engulfment of whole cells should not be considered a strict criteria to define cell death as, under some circumstances, live engulfed cells can be released from phagosomes (see PMID:18045538)." [GOC:mah, GOC:mtg_apoptosis, PMID:25236395]
comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation, it is currently kept in GO as a placeholder for describing cell death phenotypes in uPHENO. When information is provided on a programmed cell death mechanism, annotations should be made to the appropriate descendant of 'cell death' (such as, but not limited to, GO:0097300 'programmed necrotic cell death' or GO:0006915 'apoptotic process'). Unintentional cell death, i.e. cell death caused by injury, ageing, or cell phenotypes observed as a result of a pathological mutation in an essential gene should NOT be annotated using GO terms.

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase. To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

name: cell quiescence
namespace: biological_process
def: "A specialized resting state that cells enter in response to cues from the cell's environment. Quiescence is characterized by the absence of cell growth and division, by a reprogramming of global gene expression, and by changes characteristic of the organism and specific cell type. Depending on external conditions, quiescence may persist until cell death or cells may resume cell growth and division. In some cell types or under certain conditions, cellular metabolism may proceed." [GOC:jb, GOC:mah]
comment: Note that terminally differentiated cells in higher eukaryotes are typically quiescent but metabolically active. Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during). Also, note that this term should not be used for direct annotation.

To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase. To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

name: positive regulation of IKACh channel activity by G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway involved in negative regulation of heart rate
namespace: biological_process
def: "A G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway that contributes to a decrease in frequency or rate of heart contraction through activation of the IKACh potassium channel. Binding of acetylcholine to a G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor (muscarinic receptor) on the surface of the signal-receiving cell results in liberation of the G-beta/gamma complex from the alpha subunit. The G-beta/gamma complex binds directly to the inward-rectifying potassium channel IKACh. Once the ion channel is activated, potassium ions (K+) flow out of the cell and cause it to hyperpolarize. In its hyperpolarized state, action potentials cannot be fired as quickly as possible, which slows the heart rate." [GOC:BHF, GOC:mtg_cardiac_conduct_nov11, Wikipedia:G_protein-gated_ion_channel]

comment: Components of the DISC (death-inducing signaling complex) may be annotated to this term. These include ligand-bound receptors such as FAS/CD95 (though care should be taken because FAS can also act as a non-apoptotic signal transducer), and signaling molecules such as FADD (FAS-associated protein with a death domain), cIAPs (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins), c-FLIPs and caspases 8 and 10. Note that GO:0097296 should only be used to annotate gene products directly involved in the initiation or start up of an inactive cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in the apoptotic signaling pathway (also known as an initiator caspase). If the evidence provided is not sufficient to account for direct activation of this enzymatic activity, consider using the more generic terms GO:2001269 positive regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic signaling pathway or GO:0043280 positive regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process.

If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation should be to 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (e.g. mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

Amphiregulin (AREG) is a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a widely expressed transmembrane tyrosine kinase. AREG is synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor protein that can engage in juxtacrine signaling on adjacent cells. Alternatively, after proteolytic processing by cell membrane proteases, mainly TACE/ADAM17, AREG is secreted and behaves as an autocrine or paracrine factor." [PMID:24463227]
