GO:0000075	cell cycle checkpoint signaling	biological_process	GO:0072407	A signaling process that controls cell cycle progression by monitoring the integrity of specific cell cycle events. A cell cycle checkpoint begins with detection of deficiencies or defects and ends with signal transduction. [GOC:mtg_cell_cycle]	This term should not be used in direct manual annotation as it should always be possible to minimally designate mitotic or meiotic checkpoint, and usually to additionally specify the checkpoint (i.e mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, mitotic DNA damage checkpoint etc).

GO:0001101	response to acid chemical	biological_process		Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus by the chemical structure of the anion portion of a dissociated acid (rather than the acid acting as a proton donor).

Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. These three structures never co-exist in the same organism.

[GOC:al, GOC:dph, GOC:jl, GOC:mtg_apoptosis, GOC:tb, PMID:14744432, PMID:18328827, Wikipedia:Caspase]	This term should be used when the annotation refers to a process that occurs in a context of apoptotic cell death. To annotate gene products involved in activation of cysteine-type endopeptidases in other cellular process (e.g., cell cycle arrest) that do not necessarily develop into an apoptotic process, please use the more general parent term GO:0097202. Examples of 'activation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process' are cytochrome c and Apaf1. When cytochrome c is released from mitochondria and forms a complex with Apaf1, they form a scaffolding platform in which the pro-caspase 9 is bound (the 'apoptosome'). The caspase is then cleaved and activated. Cytochrome c and Apaf1 are therefore involved in the conversion of the zymogen procaspase 9 to the active form of the caspase.	gocheck_do_not_annotate	caspase activation EXACT [GOC:dph, GOC:tb]		GO:0043280 ! positive regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process

While a broader definition of behavior encompassing plants and single cell organisms would be justified on the basis of some usage (see PMID:20160973 for discussion), GO uses a tight definition that limits behavior to animals and to responses involving the nervous system, excluding plant responses that GO classifies under development, and responses of unicellular organisms that has general classifications for covering the responses of cells in multicellular organisms (e.g. cell chemotaxis).	goslim_flybase_ribbon	single-organism behavior RELATED []	Wikipedia:Behavior	GO:0032501 ! multicellular organismal process

GO:0008219	cell death	biological_process		Any biological process that results in permanent cessation of all vital functions of a cell. A cell should be considered dead when any one of the following molecular or morphological criteria is met: (1) the cell has lost the integrity of its plasma membrane; (2) the cell, including its nucleus, has undergone complete fragmentation into discrete bodies (frequently referred to as apoptotic bodies). The cell corpse (or its fragments) may be engulfed by an adjacent cell in vivo, but engulfment of whole cells should not be considered a strict criteria to define cell death as, under some circumstances, live engulfed cells can be released from phagosomes (see PMID:18045538).

GO:0086095	positive regulation of IKACh channel activity by G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway involved in negative regulation of heart rate	biological_process		A G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway that contributes to a decrease in frequency or rate of heart contraction through activation of the IKACh potassium channel. Binding of acetylcholine to a G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor (muscarinic receptor) on the surface of the signal-receiving cell results in liberation of the G-beta/gamma complex from the alpha subunit. The G-beta/gamma complex binds directly to the inward-rectifying potassium channel IKACh. Once the ion channel is activated, potassium ions (K+) flow out of the cell and cause it to hyperpolarize. In its hyperpolarized state, action potentials cannot be fired as quickly as possible, which slows the heart rate.
