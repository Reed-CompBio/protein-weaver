511145.b2511	der	490	GTPase; GTPase that plays an essential role in the late steps of ribosome biogenesis. GTPase point mutations (but not a deletion mutant) are suppressed by mild overexpression of RelA, probably due to increased levels of the stringent response mediator (p)ppGpp. 50S subunits assembled in the absence of Der are defective and unable to assemble into 70S ribosomes.

511145.b2520	yfhM	1653	Bacterial alpha2-macroglobulin colonization factor ECAM; Protects the bacterial cell from host peptidases. Acts by a 'trapping' mechanism. Cleavage of the bait-region domain by host peptidases leads to a global conformational change, which results in entrapment of the host peptidase and activation of the thioester bond that covalently binds the attacking host peptidase. Trapped peptidases are still active except against very large substrates. May protect the entire periplam, including the lipoproteins anchored to the periplasmic side of the outer membrane, against intruding endopeptidases.

511145.b2529	iscU	128	Iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold protein; A scaffold on which IscS assembles Fe-S clusters. Exists as 2 interconverting forms, a structured (S) and disordered (D) form. The D- state is the preferred substrate for IscS. Converts to the S-state when an Fe-S cluster is assembled, which helps it dissociate from IscS to transfer the Fe-S to an acceptor. It is likely that Fe-S cluster coordination is flexible as the role of this complex is to build and then hand off Fe-S clusters; Belongs to the NifU family.
511145.b2530	iscS	404	Cysteine desulfurase (tRNA sulfurtransferase), PLP-dependent; Master enzyme that delivers sulfur to a number of partners involved in Fe-S cluster assembly, tRNA modification or cofactor biosynthesis.

511145.b4599	yneM	31	Inner membrane-associated protein; Modulates intracellular Mg(2+) levels to maintain cellular integrity upon Mg(2+) limitation. Acts by binding and stabilizing the Mg(2+) transporter MgtA, thereby leading to increased intracellular level of Mg(2+). May inhibit FtsH proteolysis of MgtA.
511145.b4601	ydgU	27	Stationary phase-induced protein.
511145.b4602	ynhF	29	Stress response membrane.
511145.b4606	ypfM	19	Stress-induced small enterobacterial protein.
511145.b4613	dinQ	27	UV-inducible membrane toxin, DinQ-AgrB type I toxin-antitoxin system; Belongs to the DinQ family.
511145.b4618	tisB	29	Toxic membrane persister formation peptide, LexA-regulated; Toxic component of a type I toxin-antitoxin (TA) system  (Probable). Overexpression causes cessation of growth, induces stress-response, a number of membrane protein genes, and leads to cell death. Inhibits ATP synthesis, ATP levels drop drastically quickly after induction. Part of the programmed response to DNA damage; damage leads to increased accumulation of the protein which slows or stops bacterial growth, probably allowing DNA repair before cells continue to grow.
511145.b4620	yjbT	92	Putative periplasmic protein; Belongs to the YjbT family.
511145.b4621	yjbS	67	Uncharacterized protein.
511145.b4622	ytcA	91	Putative inner membrane efflux pump-associated DUF1656 family protein.
511145.b4637	uof	28	ryhB-regulated fur leader peptide; Cotranscribed with fur, it is essential for fur translation. The fur ribosomal binding site (RBS) is occluded by the 5'-mRNA secondary structure, which is opened by uof translation.
511145.b4655	ythA	41	Uncharacterized protein.
511145.b4662	sgrT	43	Inhibitor of glucose uptake; Acts to promote recovery from glucose-phosphate stress due to intracellular accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate caused by disruption of glycolytic flux or in the presence of (toxic) non-metabolizable glucose phosphate analogs. It may do so by inhibiting the transporter activity for glucose uptake (PtsG) as cells that overexpress this protein do not seem to import glucose although they have nearly wild- type levels of PtsG.
511145.b4663	azuC	28	Acid-inducible small membrane-associated protein.
511145.b4664	ibsD	19	Toxic membrane protein.

511145.b4667	ibsA	19	Toxic membrane protein.
511145.b4668	ibsB	18	Toxic membrane protein.

511145.b4685	yrbN	26	Uncharacterized protein.
511145.b4686	yshB	36	Uncharacterized protein.
511145.b4687	shoB	26	Toxic membrane protein; Toxic component of a type I toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. May be a toxic protein; overexpression causes cessation of growth and rapid membrane depolarization. Overexpression induces stress-response and a number of membrane protein genes.
511145.b4689	rzoQ	84	Putative Rz1-like lipoprotein, Qin prophage; Completely contained in another CDS.
511145.b4702	mgtL	17	Regulatory leader peptide for mgtA; Makes mgtA transcription sensitive to intracellular proline levels. Under low levels of proline this protein cannot be fully translated, and a stem loop forms which permits transcription of the downstream mgtA gene (By similarity).
511145.b4703	pmrR	29	Putative membrane-bound BasS regulator; May bind to BasS and modulate its sensor kinase activity.
511145.b4705	mntS	42	Mn(2)-response protein, MntR-repressed; Required for repression of mntH by MntR. May function as a chaperone that makes manganese more available by delivering it to the necessary cellular locations when manganese is limiting.
511145.b4706	iroK	21	3-hydroxypropionic acid resistance peptide; Completely contained in another CDS.
